Test cases for Project 3 of COMP10001 (2016s1)

## How to use GITHUB for Project 3:

To use github in the most basic sense you can either download the whole package of files using the button to the right marked "Download", or unpack into your local directory. You do not need an account to do this.

You can also click directly on one of the files above to view its contents and the history of changes made to it, such as test cases added or changed.

If you're interested, you may wish to create a github account (free + bonuses for uni students) to use as a version control system, paricularly useful if you use an offline/local editor. For those looking to go further with programming, github can be useful to show off completed projects/project involvement to prospective employers.

## How to use the testing script

Place the full contents of this repository in the same directory as your project code (in a single file named `program.py`), and execute `proj3_test_code.py`. The script will print out each test as it runs, and an indication of whether each individual test succeeded or not (as well as the overall count of tests for each function which succeeded).

## Contributing extra test cases

I would be very happy to incorporate extra test cases into the minimal set I put together. You can do this by emailing them to me, or if you want to embrace github fully, you can [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).
